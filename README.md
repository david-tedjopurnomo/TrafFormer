A long-term traffic prediction (i.e., up to 24 hours) model using Transformer models. I developed this model for my thesis. The model uses the encoder part of a Transformer combined with a time-day embedding module to encode temporal information. Short and long-term past traffic data are fed into the model, where these data are denoted with $X$ and $X'$ respectively.
